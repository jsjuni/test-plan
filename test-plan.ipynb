    "## Sample Requirement Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the terminology above, we generate a set of named quantities, a set of named scenarios, and a set of named requirements. Each requirement applies during a disjunction of unnamed situations. These situations are conjunctions of scenarios and can be represented by the sets of scenarios to be conjoined. Because a scenario is itself a conjunction of constraints, a situation expresses a set of constraints in _disjunctive normal form_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because constraints necessarily limit the state space, an empty situation denotes _always and everywhere_. A requirement such as \"The vehicle dry mass shall not exceed 1500 kg.\" is interpreted to apply during an empty situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each generated requirement is randomly a disjunction of one or two situations, each of which is randomly assigned a conjunction of zero to five scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each requirement is randomly assigned a quantity to constrain. For the purposes of this experiment, the particular constraint is irrelevant."

    "## Grouping by Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "If two or more requirements apply in the same situation, it may be more efficient (and/or less error-prone) to verify them in a single activity with that situation in effect. Accordingly, the first step in the workflow is to group requirements by situation. Having done so, we obtain a map from each unique situation to the requirements that explictly apply during that situation and the quantities constrained by those requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is impractical to conduct \"blind\" testing in a rigorous sense (the constraints imposed by requirements are known to testers), there is an argument that the requirements verification process should be separated into a data collection step that merely collects observations of constrained quantities regardless of the actual constraints, and a subsequent step (perhaps performed by others) that verifies conformance of those observations with the relevant constraints. In the following, we focus on the data collection activities. The verification step is a straightforward computation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some real-world scenarios may be impractical, if not impossible, to replicate in a test venue. A spacecraft requirement that applies \"during interplanetary cruise\", for example, would not generally be verified by placing the spacecraft on an interplanetary cruise trajectory. Instead, we would assert a set of scenarios that may involve use of test facilities (e.g., in the thermal vacuum chamber), fixtures (e.g., attached to ground support equipment), environmental simulations (e.g., a heat lamp intensity value) that stand as proxies for the real world for the purpose of testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a requirement that applies \"always and everywhere\" is denoted with an empty situation. For example, a vehicle dry mass requirement may apply in principle to its entire lifetime. For practical reasons, however, we would expect to verify it _once_ under a particular scenario (on a scale). So while the requirement's situation is empty, its configuration is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general case, the verification planning for each requirement will entail enumerating the sets of scenarios under which it is to be tested and explaining how these proxy scenario sets adequately represent the real world situations. In keeping with existing verification and validation practices, we call these testing scenario sets _configurations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping of situations to configurations is antecedent to (and peripheral to) the analysis that follows, so we do not address it further. For the purpose of this demonstration, we simply take the original situations as the test configurations. In practice, the set of configurations may be larger than, smaller than, or the same size as the set of situations."
