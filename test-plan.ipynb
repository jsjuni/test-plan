    "## Sample Requirement Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the terminology above, we generate a set of named quantities, a set of named scenarios, and a set of named requirements. Each requirement applies during a disjunction of unnamed situations. These situations are conjunctions of scenarios and can be represented by the sets of scenarios to be conjoined. Because a scenario is itself a conjunction of constraints, a situation expresses a set of constraints in _disjunctive normal form_.\n",

    "Because constraints necessarily limit the state space, an empty situation denotes _always and everywhere_. A requirement such as \"The vehicle dry mass shall not exceed 1500 kg.\" is interpreted to apply during an empty situation.\n",

    "Each generated requirement is randomly a disjunction of one or two situations, each of which is randomly assigned a conjunction of zero to five scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each requirement is randomly assigned a quantity to constrain. For the purposes of this experiment, the particular constraint is irrelevant."

    "## Grouping by Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "If two or more requirements apply in the same situation, it may be more efficient (and/or less error-prone) to verify them in a single activity with that situation in effect. Accordingly, the first step in the workflow is to group requirements by situation. Having done so, we obtain a map from each unique situation to the requirements that explictly apply during that situation and the quantities constrained by those requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is impractical to conduct \"blind\" testing in a rigorous sense (the constraints imposed by requirements are known to testers), there is an argument that the requirements verification process should be separated into a data collection step that merely collects observations of constrained quantities regardless of the actual constraints, and a subsequent step (perhaps performed by others) that verifies conformance of those observations with the relevant constraints. In the following, we focus on the data collection activities. The verification step is a straightforward computation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some real-world scenarios may be impractical, if not impossible, to replicate in a test venue. A spacecraft requirement that applies \"during interplanetary cruise\", for example, would not generally be verified by placing the spacecraft on an interplanetary cruise trajectory. Instead, we would assert a set of scenarios that may involve use of test facilities (e.g., in the thermal vacuum chamber), fixtures (e.g., attached to ground support equipment), environmental simulations (e.g., a heat lamp intensity value) that stand as proxies for the real world for the purpose of testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a requirement that applies \"always and everywhere\" is denoted with an empty situation. For example, a vehicle dry mass requirement may apply in principle to its entire lifetime. For practical reasons, however, we would expect to verify it _once_ under a particular scenario (on a scale). So while the requirement's situation is empty, its configuration is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general case, the verification planning for each requirement will entail enumerating the sets of scenarios under which it is to be tested and explaining how these proxy scenario sets adequately represent the real world situations. In keeping with existing verification and validation practices, we call these testing scenario sets _configurations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping of situations to configurations is antecedent to (and peripheral to) the analysis that follows, so we do not address it further. For the purpose of this demonstration, we simply take the original situations as the test configurations. In practice, the set of configurations may be larger than, smaller than, or the same size as the set of situations."

    "We define a _reconfiguration cost_ between any two configurations _C_<sub>1</sub> and _C_<sub>2</sub> as the sum of the teardown costs for all scenarios in _C_<sub>1</sub> but not in _C_<sub>2</sub>, plus the sum of the setup costs for all scenarios in _C_<sub>2</sub> but not in _C_<sub>1</sub>.\n",

    "By definition, if a requirement applies in a particular configuration _C_<sub>1</sub>, then it applies in any configuration _C_<sub>2</sub> for which _C_<sub>1</sub> ⊆ _C_<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "For example, if _C_<sub>1</sub> corresponds to the scenario set {_S_<sub>1</sub>, _S_<sub>2</sub>} and _C_<sub>2</sub> corresponds to the scenario set {_S_<sub>1</sub>, _S_<sub>2</sub>, _S_<sub>3</sub>}, then\n",
    "the state of the world represented by by _C_<sub>2</sub> (_S_<sub>1</sub> ∧ _S_<sub>2</sub> ∧ _S_<sub>3</sub>) implies the state of the world implied by _C_<sub>1</sub> (_S_<sub>1</sub> ∧ _S_<sub>2</sub>), and therefore\n",
    "any requirement that applies during _C_<sub>1</sub> also applies during _C_<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, this fact may enlarge the set of requirements applicable in a configuration, and therefore may also enlarge the set of constrained quantities, and consequently the set of observed quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world considerations may allow us to assert that some configurations suffice for others (with regard to a given requirement). For example, a requirement on vehicle braking may explicitly apply to all conditions on a test track, but for the purposes of verification one might determine that \"test track with wet roadway\" is a bounding case that suffices for all others. This is an example of a more restrictive configuration sufficing for a less restrictive one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, a less restrictive configuration might suffice. For example, a requirement for a seat belt warning indicator might be tested while driving on a test track, but not under every possible driving condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the case of the proxy scenarios, the assertion of sufficiency is an engineering judgment to made carefully and with a full apprecation of the factors that constitute valid testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this demonstration, we apply a simulator algorithm that, for each requirement, chooses randomly (with equal probability) whether to sample from the least or most restrictive configurations in which that requirement applies, and then chooses exactly one configuration randomly from that sample. This is, of course, a  representation of the _result_ of a complete sufficiency argument, but is in no sense a representation of a valid sufficiency reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sufficiency assertions reduce the set of requirements that apply to some configuration, and may therefore reduce the set of observed quantities. If the set of requirements for a configuration is emptied, the configuration is removed. Sufficiency assertions, therefore, may reduce the total number of observations and the number of distinct configurations in the campaign."
